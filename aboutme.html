 <p>  July  6,2017: If I had more time to work on my shapes in Scratch, I would have the cat ask the user to
 <pre>    enter in a color. In doing so, the cat will draw the desired sided shape and will also draw the shape
 <pre>    in the desired color. I would also allow the color to fill in the shape.
 <pre>  After seeing others presentations in drawing shapes in Scratch, I was surprised how they were able to
 <pre>    fill in their shapes with colors, because I did not have enough time to do so myself.</pre></pre></pre></pre></p>
 <br>     
 <p>  July  7,2017: If I had the chance to arrange the classroom, I would put the tables together into a more
 <pre>     connected way; because with the tables in groups of four, I do not have the ablility to spend time and
 <pre>     work with the other girls who are across the classroom.
 <pre>   One person I have learned from is Leah, because she helped me in Scratch when I wanted to shrink my
 <pre>     shape based on the number of sides the input was. For example if the shape was 20 sides then the shape
 <pre>     would be draw with 60 steps per side instead of 75. She also has helped me in understanding the process
 <pre>     of social skills and making friends.</pre></pre></pre></pre></pre></pre></p>
 <br>
 <p>  July 10,2017: When making my website accessable to others, I would provide audio for those who can not see
 <pre>     and clear, simple words and sign language for those who can not hear.
 <pre>   When I looked at my fellow girls who code friends, I saw that on their websites, they were using text
 <pre>     alignment, background colors, and background designs. When looking at their websites, I realized that they
 <pre>     were able to do this by using the style and image tags.
 <pre>   Today I am most proud of learning how to create my own portfolio online. I can not wait until I have my
 <pre>     own blog or wewbsite when I am older.</pre></pre></pre></pre></pre></pre></p>
 <br>
 <p>  July 11,2017: Between both scratch and python, I think one of the differences is that while scratch 
 <pre>     gives you the strings and booleans, on python, you have to create them yourself. Also, on python, one 
 <pre>     mistake really causes a problem with the whole code.</pre></pre></p>
 <br>
 <p>  July 17,2017: When I think about robotics knowledge in todays time and what the subject holds for the
 <pre>     future, it makes me quite nervous and fearful. I feel this way, because with technology, I believe 
 <pre>     that we consume ourselves in it, and in doing so, we become more vulnerable to the dangers virtual 
 <pre>     and real life hold when intertwined to much.
 <pre>   Today we also worked in groups of five. Even though i have a hard time with group work, my group 
 <pre>     and I worked very well with each other. BY designating parts and allowing each other of voice our 
 <pre>     opinions and thoughts on the matter, and asking for help, we accomplished the goal of getting the 
 <pre>     LED light to light up. However, I also became quite distracted sometimes, which made me a bad group 
 <pre>     member. On that realization, for the rest of the week, I have to be more focused on my group and the 
 <pre>     work we do; then talking to them on unrelated topics alot of the time.</pre></pre></pre></pre></pre></pre></pre></pre></pre></p>
 <br>
 <p>  July 19,2017: When we started to program the robots to dance, my favorite part was that my group and I
 <pre>     were able to program it to move forwards and backwards and turn at different angles.</pre></p>                                                                                                                                                
 <br>
 <p>  July 25,2017: What I have not understand at all yet or are experiencing problems with is creating a button 
 <pre>     on this portfoilo with Javascript. I would really like to get this button to work where when it is 
 <pre>     clicked on, it will show this reflection. 
 <pre>   In general, I would like to have more practice in CSS, Javascript, and HTML; however, I would also like 
 <pre>     to have more practice in python.</pre></pre></pre></pre></p>
 <br>
 <p>  July 26,2017: On my Django site, I would like to add tabs and buttons. I would also add pictures and ways 
 <pre>     for the client or person using my website to beable to interact with my website. Lastly, I would write my 
 <pre>     biography and possibly my artistic ideas. I might also add a chat room to where I can voice my ideas to others.</pre></pre></p>
 <br>
 <p>  July 28,2017: When coding, there are dictionarys and lists. The difference between the two is that a dictionary
 <pre>     is an unorder set of strings, integers, etc., and a list is an ordered set of strings, integers, etc.. A dictionary 
 <pre>     is written like this: {key:value, key:value, key:value, etc..}, and a looks like this: [list, list, list, etc.].</pre></pre></p>     
 <br>
 <p>  July 31,2017: Today I am most proud of figuring out what Public Key Cryptography is. At first I did not understand what
 <pre>     Public Key Cryptography was, but once I realized that it involved crypthography, I began to develop a slight 
 <pre>     understanding. There are two keys, a public and private. The public key is what everyone can see, while the private 
 <pre>     key is the owner of the encryption. The owner of the encryption is the only one who can decode the encryption, 
 <pre>     unless he/she shares how to decode it. The public key also has a digital signature. This signature proves that the 
 <pre>     sender has or also has access to the private key; and it ensures that the message has not been tampered with.</pre></pre></pre></pre></pre></p>

   <h1 style="text-align:left;">What I learned:</h1>
 <p> July 17,2017: Today I learned that when we create circuits, you want to not let the electricity take the 
 <pre>     easyist path, because then it might not work. You have to be exact so when turned out, the energy only
 <pre>     has one choice. I also learned that the Board of Education(BOE) shield is connected to Arduino, which 
 <pre>     is used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.</pre></pre></pre></p>
 <br>
 <p> July 20,2017: Today I learned how to embrace insiquirites. While working on a code to make my groups
 <pre>     robot move on of a three sided box, I began to drop my heavily guarded shields; I began to sing and 
 <pre>     dance along. I love being able to be apart of this program and I am so thankfully that I was one of the
 <pre>     girls chosen to be here for these seven weeks. We are finishing week three, so technically I have not
 <pre>     known these girls for long; however, I feel like ive known them for years and will continue to work and
 <pre>     become one of there "sisters".</pre></pre></pre></pre></pre></p>
 <br>
 <p> July 24,2017: I learned that when sending information across the internet, the information, when sent,
 <pre>     breaks up into mutiple packages. Once these packages reach their destination, they begin to piece back 
 <pre>     together the desired information. I also learned that there are many steps in sending an email. The first
 <pre>     step is that the client -in this case your laptop - sends information to the DNS or Domain Name Server. The 
 <pre>     DNS is like AT&T or Version. Once at the DNS, the information is then sent to the server or interent. The 
 <pre>     server then sends information back to the DNS who sends that information back to the Client. Once the client
 <pre>     recieves the information, the client sends information to the server who sends information back to the client.
 <pre>   Knowing that LaTex is a language that allows people to format documents, I would say that LaTex is a markup 
 <pre>     language. I believe this because markup languages are like HTML where programming languages are used to 
 <pre>     communicate from one computer to another.</pre></pre></pre></pre></pre></pre></pre></pre></pre></p>

    <h1 style="text-align:left;">Questions and Thoughts:</h1>
 <p> August 3,2017: When I was creating a very basic social network Tuesday, I had most trouble with actually starting and
 <pre>     understanding what to do. I still do not know what to do, but hopefully the teacher and teacher assistents will 
 <pre>     beable to explain what to do, and help me understand if I wrote the code properly. 
 <pre>   I think in the code, it would be fun to, once the basics are done, to have a section for a comment of what you 
 <pre>     are doing write now and a birthday slot; so when someone looks up your username, they will see what you are doing 
 <pre>     and your birthday. Adding a talking section between users would be nice too.</pre></pre></pre></pre></pre></p>
