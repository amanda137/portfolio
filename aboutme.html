    July  6,2017: If I had more time to work on my shapes in Scratch, I would have the cat ask the user to
      enter in a color. In doing so, the cat will draw the desired sided shape and will also draw the shape
      in the desired color. I would also allow the color to fill in the shape.
      After seeing others presentations in drawing shapes in Scratch, I was surprised how they were able to
      fill in their shapes with colors, because I did not have enough time to do so myself.
    July  7,2017: If I had the chance to arrange the classroom, I would put the tables together into a more
      connected way; because with the tables in groups of four, I do not have the ablility to spend time and
      work with the other girls who are across the classroom.
      One person I have learned from is Leah, because she helped me in Scratch when I wanted to shrink my
      shape based on the number of sides the input was. For example if the shape was 20 sides then the shape
      would be draw with 60 steps per side instead of 75. She also has helped me in understanding the process
      of social skills and making friends.
    July 10,2017: When making my website accessable to others, I would provide audio for those who can not see
      and clear, simple words and sign language for those who can not hear.
      When I looked at my fellow girls who code friends, I saw that on their websites, they were using text
      alignment, background colors, and background designs. When looking at their websites, I realized that they
      were able to do this by using the style and image tags.
      Today I am most proud of learning how to create my own portfolio online. I can not wait until I have my
      own blog or wewbsite when I am older.
    July 11,2017: Between both scratch and python, I think one of the differences is that while scratch 
      gives you the strings and booleans, on python, you have to create them yourself. Also, on python, one 
      mistake really causes a problem with the whole code.
    July 17,2017: When I think about robotics knowledge in todays time and what the subject holds for the
      future, it makes me quite nervous and fearful. I feel this way, because with technology, I believe 
      that we consume ourselves in it, and in doing so, we become more vulnerable to the dangers virtual 
      and real life hold when intertwined to much.
      Today we also worked in groups of five. Even though i have a hard time with group work, my group 
      and I worked very well with each other. BY designating parts and allowing each other of voice our 
      opinions and thoughts on the matter, and asking for help, we accomplished the goal of getting the 
      LED light to light up. However, I also became quite distracted sometimes, which made me a bad group 
      member. On that realization, for the rest of the week, I have to be more focused on my group and the 
      work we do; then talking to them on unrelated topics alot of the time.
    July 19,2017: When we started to program the robots to dance, my favorite part was that my group and I
      were able to program it to move forwards and backwards and turn at different angles.
    July 25,2017: What I have not understand at all yet or are experiencing problems with is creating a button 
      on this portfoilo with Javascript. I would really like to get this button to work where when it is 
      clicked on, it will show this reflection. 
      In general, I would like to have more practice in CSS, Javascript, and HTML; however, I would also like 
      to have more practice in python);

    <h1 style="text-align:left;">What I learned:</h1>
    <p> July 17,2017: Today I learned that when we create circuits, you want to not let the electricity take the 
    <pre> easyist path, because then it might not work. You have to be exact so when turned out, the energy only
    <pre> has one choice. I also learned that the Board of Education(BOE) shield is connected to Arduino, which 
    <pre> is used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.</pre></pre></pre></p>
    <br>
    <p> July 20,2017: Today I learned how to embrace insiquirites. While working on a code to make my groups
    <pre> robot move on of a three sided box, I began to drop my heavily guarded shields; I began to sing and 
    <pre> dance along. I love being able to be apart of this program and I am so thankfully that I was one of the
    <pre> girls chosen to be here for these seven weeks. We are finishing week three, so technically I have not
    <pre> known these girls for long; however, I feel like ive known them for years and will continue to work and
    <pre> become one of there "sisters".</pre></pre></pre></pre></pre></p>
    <br>
    <p> July 24,2017: I learned that when sending information across the internet, the information, when sent,
    <pre> breaks up into mutiple packages. Once these packages reach their destination, they begin to piece back 
    <pre> together the desired information. I also learned that there are many steps in sending an email. The first
    <pre> step is that the client -in this case your laptop - sends information to the DNS or Domain Name Server. The 
    <pre> DNS is like AT&T or Version. Once at the DNS, the information is then sent to the server or interent. The 
    <pre> server then sends information back to the DNS who sends that information back to the Client. Once the client
    <pre> recieves the information, the client sends information to the server who sends information back to the client.
    <p>     Knowing that LaTex is a language that allows people to format documents, I would say that LaTex is a markup 
    <pre> language. I believe this because markup languages are like HTML where programming languages are used to 
    <pre> communicate from one computer to another.
