    <h1 style="text-align:left;">Reflection:</h1>
    <p> July 11,2017: Between both scratch and python, I think one of the differences is that while scratch 
    <pre> gives you the strings and booleans, on python, you have to create them yourself. Also, on python, one 
    <pre> mistake really causes a problem with the whole code.</pre></pre></p>
    <p> July 17,2017: When I think about robotics knowledge in todays time and what the subject holds for the
    <pre> future, it makes me quite nervous and fearful. I feel this way, because with technology, I believe 
    <pre> that we consume ourselves in it, and in doing so, we become more vulnerable to the dangers virtual 
    <pre> and real life hold when intertwined to much.
    <pre> Today we also worked in groups of five. Even though i have a hard time with group work, my group 
    <pre> and I worked very well with each other. BY designating parts and allowing each other of voice our 
    <pre> opinions and thoughts on the matter, and asking for help, we accomplished the goal of getting the 
    <pre> LED light to light up. However, I also became quite distracted sometimes, which made me a bad group 
    <pre> member. On that realization, for the rest of the week, I have to be more focused on my group and the 
    <pre> work we do; then talking to them on unrelated topics alot of the time.</pre></pre></pre></pre></pre></pre></pre></pre></pre></p>

    <h1 style="text-align:left;">What I learned:</h1>
    <p> July 17,2017: Today I learned that when we create circuits, you want to not let the electricity take the 
    <pre> easyist path, because then it might not work. You have to be exact so when turned out, the energy only
    <pre> has one choice. I also learned that the Board of Education(BOE) shield is connected to Arduino, which 
    <pre> is used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.</pre></pre></pre></p>
