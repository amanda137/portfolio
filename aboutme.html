    <h1 style="text-align:left;">Reflection:</h1>
    <p> July 11,2017: Between both scratch and python, i think one of the differences is that while scratch gives you the strings and booleans, on python, you have to create them yourself. 
    <pre>also, on python, one mistake really causes a problem with the whole code.</pre></p>

    <h1 style="text-align:left;">What I learned:</h1>
    <p> July 17,2017: Today I learned that when we create circuits, you want to not let the electricity take the 
    <pre> easyist path, because then it might not work. You have to be exact so when turned out, the energy only
    <pre> has one choice. I also learned that the Board of Education(BOE) shield is connected to Arduino, which 
    <pre> is used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.</pre></pre></pre></p>
